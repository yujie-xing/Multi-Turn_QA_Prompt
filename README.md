# Multi-Turn_QA_Prompt

Re-produce the prompt methods for multi-turn QA described in https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14796 with GPT-2. Now you can also use the instruction methods similar to InstructDIal (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.12673.pdf) and ProQA (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.04040.pdf).

prompted CoQA and QuAC datasets are included.

PS: Although I added some codes for the longformer model, it is not working as expected. The GPT-2 model works as expected, though.
